I'm delphonso

I'm currently learning Python(and GDScript) and Rust and admiring C++ from afar. 

I'm interested in gamedev and open engine projects. I also like to over engineer solutions to problems that people have already solved, 
thus wasting my time excellently. 

I'm up to collaborate in any way I can on open-source utilities.
